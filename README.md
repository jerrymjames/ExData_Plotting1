# ExData_Plotting

Following are the functionalities of each R file 

Plot1.R :1.  Downloads the data from 
                           "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip"

         2. Read and transform the data to the session variables
         
         3. Plots the graph 1 and saves the plot as "plot1.png"
         
        
Plot2.R : Plots the graph 2 and saves the plot as "plot2.png"

Plot3.R : Plots the graph 2 and saves the plot as "plot3.png"

Plot4.R : Plots the graph 2 and saves the plot as "plot4.png"

Execution order :

1. Run the script in Plot1.R file as the  first run
2. Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R can be processed in any order as Plot1.R saves all the required variables in the session
